"""
Flag honeypot candidates using OR-logic across independent rules (see
ARCHITECTURE.md section 6). Any single rule firing flags the candidate --
this deliberately avoids averaging risk scores, which would let one
strong red flag get diluted by other normal-looking signals and slip
under a threshold.

Usage:
    python honeypot_flags.py \
        --features ./artifacts/features.parquet \
        --out ./artifacts/honeypot_flags.parquet
