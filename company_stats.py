NOTE (2026-09-20): NO LONGER USED by the pipeline. honeypot_flags.py dropped
the rule that consumed this output ("tenure predates the inferred founding"):
the candidate schema has no founding date, so the date was inferred from other
candidates' start dates and the rule flagged ~17.5% of the pool regardless of
role (see redrob_ranking_architecture.md section 6). The script is kept for
reference only.

Build per-company first-seen statistics from career_history across the
full candidate pool. Formerly used by honeypot_flags.py to catch "tenure
predates the company's existence" honeypots.

Tier A: companies mentioned by >=5 candidates -> we use a LOW PERCENTILE
  (roughly the 10th percentile) of start_date across all mentions as the
  inferred "earliest plausible" date -- not the median, which for small
  samples is just a midpoint (with only 2 mentions, one of them is
  mathematically guaranteed to fall "before" the median, which is a
  coin-flip, not a robustness check). A low percentile with a large
  enough n approximates a lower bound instead.

Tier B: companies mentioned by 1-4 candidates -> not enough independent
  data to trust any statistic, including a percentile. honeypot_flags.py
  does NOT use this script's output for Tier B companies -- it falls back
  to standalone rules instead (skill-count-vs-experience, employment
  overlap, duration-consistency checks) that don't need another
  candidate's data to work.

Usage:
    python company_stats.py \
        --features ./artifacts/features.parquet \
        --out ./artifacts/company_stats.parquet
